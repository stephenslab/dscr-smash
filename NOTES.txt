=====

+ How long is run_dsc expected to run for?

+ Is ashr needed? It is mentioned in the README, but doesn't seem to
  be used anywhere in the code.

+ Are any special MATLAB toolboxes needed?

+ I'm using R 3.4.3 and MATLAB R2016b (9.1.0.441655).

+ I'm using these R packages:

   - AlgDesign 1.1-7.3
   - ashr 2.2-7
   - dscr 0.1-7
   - EbayesThresh 1.4-12
   - smashr 1.2-0
   - wavethresh 4.6.8

+ I'm using these MATLAB packages:
   - WaveLab 850
   - WavDen (no version number is given)

+ Steps I took to run code:
   - Launch R.
   - Make sure working directory is the root of the git repository.
