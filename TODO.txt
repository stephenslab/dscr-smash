to do 
=====

* Merge this code with smash-paper, and re-organize.

* Is graphs.Rmd needed? If so, add packages used in graphs.Rmd to
  setup instructions.

* Add sessionInfo() to README.

* Fix system statements that use 'rm' command.

* Add more verbose to running methods, particularly methods that call
  MATLAB, so we know what is going on when things go wrong.

* Add Wavelab and WavDen code to this repo.
